# Welcome To "BUDGET APP" 
This app will help you out keeping track of your expenses with a limited budget.

## How does it work?
You have to set a budget and once it's done you will be able to add your expenses.
In this section you can add expenses by clicking the blue button at the bottom right corner of the app and they will show up in cards.
You might want to filter your expenses by category using the button placed below the graph.
You can also ```RESET``` the budget, including the available and expended amount.
